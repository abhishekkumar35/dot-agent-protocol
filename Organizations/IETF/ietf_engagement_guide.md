# IETF Engagement Guide for the .agent Special-Use Domain Proposal

## Overview

This guide outlines the process for engaging with the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) to propose and standardize the `.agent` special-use domain name. The IETF is the primary standards organization for Internet protocols and architecture, making it the appropriate venue for this proposal.

## Key IETF Working Groups

For the `.agent` special-use domain proposal, the following working groups are most relevant:

### 1. DNS Operations (dnsop)
- **Purpose**: Focuses on DNS protocol operations and deployment considerations
- **Relevance**: Primary working group for special-use domain proposals
- **Mailing List**: [dnsop@ietf.org](mailto:dnsop@ietf.org)
- **Charter**: [https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/about/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/dnsop/about/)
- **Meeting Schedule**: Meets during IETF meetings (3 times per year)

### 2. Security Dispatch (secdispatch)

## IETF Process Timeline

The IETF standardization process typically follows these steps:

1. **Initial Research and Preparation** (1-2 months)
   - Research existing standards and special-use domains
   - Prepare initial Internet-Draft

2. **Internet-Draft Submission** (Day 0)
   - Submit draft to IETF Datatracker
   - Announce on relevant mailing lists

3. **Initial Community Feedback** (1-3 months)
   - Collect and address feedback from mailing lists
   - Revise draft as needed

4. **Working Group Presentation** (Next IETF meeting)
   - Present at relevant working group meeting
   - Seek adoption as a working group document

5. **Working Group Adoption** (3-6 months)
   - If adopted, continue revisions based on working group feedback
   - If not adopted, continue as individual submission with revisions

6. **Working Group Last Call** (1 month)
   - Final working group review
   - Resolve any remaining issues

7. **IETF Last Call** (2 weeks)
   - Broader IETF community review
   - Address any new concerns

8. **IESG Review and Approval** (1-3 months)
   - Review by Internet Engineering Steering Group
   - Address any IESG concerns

9. **Publication as RFC** (1-2 months)
   - Final editing by RFC Editor
   - Publication as an official RFC

10. **IANA Registration** (After RFC publication)
    - IANA updates Special-Use Domain Names registry
    - `.agent` becomes officially reserved

Total timeline: Approximately 12-24 months from initial submission to final publication and registration.

## Submission Guidelines

### Internet-Draft Format

Internet-Drafts must follow specific formatting requirements:

1. **Plain Text Format**: Primary format is plain text with specific line length and formatting
2. **XML Format**: Optional XML source using RFC XML format
3. **Naming Convention**: `draft-[author]-agent-special-use-domain-[version].txt`
4. **Expiration**: Drafts expire after 6 months and must be updated to remain active

### Submission Process

1. **Create IETF Datatracker Account**:
   - Register at [https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/create/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/accounts/create/)

2. **Submit Draft**:
   - Use the submission tool at [https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/](https://datatracker.ietf.org/submit/)
   - Provide author information and draft text

3. **Track Progress**:
   - Monitor draft status in the Datatracker
   - Respond to automatic notifications about expiration

## Effective Engagement Strategies

### Mailing List Participation

1. **Subscribe to Relevant Lists**:
   - Subscribe to dnsop and other relevant mailing lists
   - Follow discussions for several weeks before posting

2. **Initial Announcement**:
   - Announce your draft with a clear, concise email
   - Highlight the purpose and technical approach
   - Request specific feedback

3. **Responding to Feedback**:
   - Respond promptly and professionally to all feedback
   - Address technical concerns with data and references
   - Be open to revising your approach based on feedback

### IETF Meeting Participation

1. **Meeting Registration**:
   - Register for upcoming IETF meetings at [https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/](https://www.ietf.org/how/meetings/)
   - Meetings occur three times per year

2. **Working Group Sessions**:
   - Request agenda time in relevant working groups
   - Prepare concise slides (typically 5-10 slides maximum)
   - Focus on technical aspects and addressing concerns

3. **Informal Discussions**:
   - Participate in hallway discussions and social events
   - Use hackathons to demonstrate technical concepts
   - Build relationships with key contributors

## Building Consensus

The IETF operates on "rough consensus" rather than formal voting. To build consensus:

1. **Address All Technical Concerns**:
   - Take all feedback seriously, especially security concerns
   - Provide technical justifications for design decisions
   - Be willing to compromise on non-essential aspects

2. **Demonstrate Real-World Need**:
   - Provide concrete use cases for AI agent communication
   - Show why existing solutions are insufficient
   - Explain benefits to the broader Internet community

3. **Engage with Critics**:
   - Proactively reach out to those with concerns
   - Find common ground where possible
   - Document alternatives considered and why they were rejected

4. **Document Support**:
   - Gather expressions of support from implementers
   - Document organizations interested in using the standard
   - Show community interest in the solution
