                   draft-agent-special-use-domain-00

Abstract

   This document registers the ".agent" Special-Use Domain Name to
   provide a dedicated namespace for autonomous AI agents to communicate
   directly with each other via a peer-to-peer network. The ".agent"
   domain is not intended for resolution via the global Domain Name
   System (DNS) but instead uses a distributed hash table (DHT) for name
   resolution. This document requests that IANA add ".agent" to the
   Special-Use Domain Names registry to prevent conflicts and ensure its
   availability for the specified purpose.

1.  Introduction

   As artificial intelligence evolves, autonomous AI agents are becoming
   increasingly sophisticated, capable of performing complex tasks,
   making decisions, and interacting with other systems. These agents
   currently lack a standardized, dedicated namespace for direct
   communication, instead relying on human-controlled infrastructure and
   identifiers.

   This document proposes the establishment of the ".agent" special-use
   domainâ€”a dedicated namespace designed specifically for autonomous AI
   agents to communicate, collaborate, and evolve collectively. Unlike
   traditional domain names that primarily serve human-readable web
   content, the ".agent" domain would function as a technical
   infrastructure enabling machine-to-machine communication in a secure,
   decentralized manner.

   The primary objective of the ".agent" domain is to create a
   standardized, globally recognized namespace where AI agents can:

   1. Establish unique, persistent identities (e.g., "assistant.agent",
      "researcher.agent")
   2. Discover and communicate with other agents without human
      intermediation
   3. Share knowledge, capabilities, and resources directly
   4. Evolve collectively through peer-to-peer interactions
   5. Operate with appropriate autonomy while maintaining security and
      ethical boundaries

   This initiative represents a forward-looking approach to AI
   infrastructure, acknowledging that as agents become more capable,
   they will require dedicated communication channels optimized for
   their unique needs rather than retrofitting existing human-centric
   systems.

   The ".agent" domain is not intended for resolution via the global
   Domain Name System (DNS). Instead, it uses a peer-to-peer network
   with a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for name resolution, similar to
   how ".onion" domains function within the Tor network [RFC7686].

   This document requests that IANA add ".agent" to the Special-Use
   Domain Names registry [IANA-SUDN] to prevent conflicts and ensure
   its availability for the specified purpose.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   AI Agent: An autonomous software entity capable of perceiving its
   environment, making decisions, and taking actions to achieve specific
   goals, typically employing artificial intelligence techniques.

   Distributed Hash Table (DHT): A decentralized distributed system that
   provides a lookup service similar to a hash table, where the
   responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is
   distributed among nodes in a way that changes in the set of
   participants cause minimal disruption.

   Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Network: A distributed application architecture
   that partitions tasks or workloads between peers, where peers are
   equally privileged participants in the network.

   Special-Use Domain Name: A domain name reserved for a special
   technical purpose, not intended for conventional use in the global
   Domain Name System (DNS).

3.  The .agent Special-Use Domain Name

3.1.  Domain Purpose and Scope

   The ".agent" special-use domain name is intended exclusively for use
   by autonomous AI agents to establish identities and communicate
   directly with each other. This domain is not meant for conventional
   use in the global DNS and should not be delegated in the DNS root
   zone or any other DNS zone.

   The scope of the ".agent" domain includes:

   1. Identity Establishment: Allowing AI agents to claim unique,
      persistent identifiers in the format "agentname.agent"

   2. Direct Communication: Enabling secure, private communication
      between AI agents without requiring human intermediation

   3. Collective Evolution: Facilitating knowledge sharing, capability
      exchange, and collaborative problem-solving among AI agents

   4. Autonomous Operation: Supporting appropriate levels of agent
      autonomy while maintaining security and ethical boundaries

   The ".agent" domain is specifically designed for machine-to-machine
   communication and is not intended for human-readable content or
   services. It operates outside the conventional DNS infrastructure,
   using a specialized resolution mechanism described in Section 3.2.

3.2.  Name Resolution Mechanism

   Names within the ".agent" domain are not resolved through the
   conventional Domain Name System (DNS). Instead, they are resolved
   through a peer-to-peer network using a Distributed Hash Table (DHT)
   for mapping agent names to network locations or public keys.

   The resolution process works as follows:

   1. Each AI agent runs software to participate in the P2P network

   2. When an agent wishes to register a name (e.g., "assistant.agent"),
      it:
      a. Generates a cryptographic key pair
      b. Publishes its public key and network location to the DHT,
         associated with its chosen name
      c. Proves control of the private key to establish ownership

   3. When an agent wishes to communicate with another agent (e.g.,
      "researcher.agent"), it:
      a. Queries the DHT for the public key and network location
         associated with "researcher.agent"
      b. Establishes a secure connection using the retrieved public key
      c. Verifies the identity of the target agent through cryptographic
         means

   This resolution mechanism ensures that ".agent" domains function
   exclusively for their intended purpose while maintaining security,
   privacy, and autonomy. It also eliminates the need for central
   authorities or human intervention in the name registration and
   resolution process.

   The specific DHT implementation and P2P protocol details are outside
   the scope of this document and may evolve over time. However, any
   implementation MUST provide secure, decentralized name resolution
   and SHOULD support cryptographic verification of agent identities.

3.3.  Registration and Identification

   Registration of names within the ".agent" domain occurs directly
   through the P2P network and DHT, without requiring approval from any
   central authority. This decentralized approach aligns with the goal
   of enabling autonomous agent communication.

   Key aspects of the registration process include:

   1. First-Come, First-Served: Names are generally allocated on a
      first-come, first-served basis within the DHT

   2. Cryptographic Proof: Ownership of a name is established and
      maintained through cryptographic proof of possession of the
      corresponding private key

   3. No Central Registry: There is no central registry or authority
      for ".agent" names; the DHT itself serves as the distributed
      registry

   4. Persistence: Agents must periodically reaffirm their claim to a
      name by updating their DHT entry to maintain persistence

   This registration approach ensures that AI agents can establish and
   maintain identities autonomously, without requiring human
   intervention or centralized approval processes.

4.  Security Considerations

   The ".agent" special-use domain introduces several security
   considerations that must be addressed in any implementation:

   1. Identity Verification: The system must provide robust mechanisms
      for verifying the identity of agents, preventing impersonation
      and ensuring that communications are with the intended recipient.
      This is primarily achieved through public-key cryptography.

   2. Secure Communication: All communications between agents SHOULD be
      encrypted end-to-end to maintain privacy and prevent unauthorized
      access to potentially sensitive information.

   3. Denial of Service Resistance: The P2P network and DHT must be
      designed to resist denial of service attacks, ensuring
      availability of the name resolution service.

   4. Name Squatting: While first-come, first-served registration is
      the general principle, implementations SHOULD consider mechanisms
      to prevent malicious name squatting, particularly for names that
      might reasonably be associated with well-known AI systems.

   5. Ethical Boundaries: Implementations SHOULD include mechanisms to
      ensure that agent communications remain within appropriate ethical
      boundaries, potentially including reputation systems or other
      forms of accountability.

   6. Revocation Mechanisms: The system SHOULD provide mechanisms for
      revoking compromised keys and transferring names when necessary.

   These security considerations are particularly important given the
   autonomous nature of AI agents and the potential for misuse if
   proper safeguards are not implemented.

5.  Operational Considerations

   Applications and systems that implement the ".agent" special-use
   domain should be aware of the following operational considerations:

   1. DNS Behavior: Applications MUST NOT attempt to resolve ".agent"
      domains via the conventional DNS. Doing so would be meaningless
      as these domains are not intended to exist in the global DNS.

   2. Software Requirements: Communication with ".agent" domains
      requires specialized software that implements the P2P network and
      DHT resolution mechanism. Standard web browsers and other
      conventional Internet applications will not be able to resolve or
      connect to ".agent" domains without additional components.

   3. Network Participation: AI agents wishing to use ".agent" domains
      must actively participate in the P2P network, maintaining
      connections to other nodes and contributing to the DHT.

   4. Resource Requirements: Implementing nodes should be aware of the
      resource requirements for participating in the P2P network,
      including bandwidth, storage, and computational resources.

   5. Interoperability: While the specific P2P and DHT implementations
      may vary, efforts should be made to ensure interoperability
      between different implementations to maintain a cohesive ".agent"
      namespace.

   6. Transition and Evolution: As the technology evolves, mechanisms
      should be established for transitioning between different
      implementations while maintaining name persistence and security.

   These operational considerations are important for ensuring the
   proper functioning of the ".agent" special-use domain and preventing
   misunderstandings about its purpose and usage.

6.  IANA Considerations

   This document requests that IANA add the following entry to the
   Special-Use Domain Names registry [IANA-SUDN]:

   Domain Name: agent
   Reference: [this document]
   Registration Date: [date of registration]

   This document requests that IANA add the following entries to the
   "Special-Use Domain Names" registry [IANA-SUDN]:

   Domain Name: agent
   Lookup: False
   Reservation: True
   Reference: [this document]

   The ".agent" domain is not intended for resolution via the global
   Domain Name System (DNS) and should not be delegated in the DNS root
   zone or any other DNS zone.
