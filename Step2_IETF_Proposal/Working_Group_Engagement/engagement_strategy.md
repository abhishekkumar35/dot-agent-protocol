# Working Group Engagement Strategy for .agent Special-Use Domain Proposal

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive strategy for engaging with IETF working groups to advance the `.agent` special-use domain proposal. Effective working group engagement is critical to building consensus, addressing technical concerns, and ultimately achieving standardization. This strategy focuses on the DNS Operations (dnsop) working group as the primary venue, with secondary engagement in related working groups.

## Primary Working Group: DNS Operations (dnsop)

### Relevance to Proposal

The DNS Operations (dnsop) working group is the primary venue for special-use domain proposals, as evidenced by previous successful special-use domain standardizations like `.onion` (RFC 7686). This working group focuses on:

- DNS protocol operations and deployment considerations
- Special-use domain name standardization
- DNS security and operational practices

### Engagement Timeline

| Phase | Timeframe | Actions |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Pre-submission | 1-2 months | Research, monitor discussions, identify key participants |
| Initial contact | Week 1 | Introductory email to mailing list with concept |
| Draft submission | Week 2 | Submit Internet-Draft, announce on list |
| Discussion period | Weeks 3-12 | Active participation in mailing list discussions |
| Meeting presentation | Next IETF meeting | Present draft during working group session |
| Revision period | 1-3 months | Incorporate feedback, submit revised draft |
| Working group adoption | 3-6 months | Request adoption as working group document |
| Working group process | 6-12 months | Continue revisions through working group process |

## Secondary Working Groups

### Security Dispatch (secdispatch)

**Relevance**: Security aspects of AI agent communication

**Engagement Approach**:
- Monitor mailing list for relevant discussions
- Submit brief overview of security aspects for consideration
- Request guidance on security considerations section
- Consider presenting if directed by chairs

### Applications and Real-Time Area (art)

**Relevance**: Application protocol aspects of AI agent communication

**Engagement Approach**:
- Inform area directors of the proposal
- Seek input on application-layer considerations
- Consider joint sessions if there is interest
- Incorporate feedback on application protocol aspects

## Addressing Common Concerns

Based on previous special-use domain proposals, we anticipate these concerns and will proactively address them:

### 1. Technical Necessity

**Anticipated Concern**: Why can't this use a conventional domain or existing special-use domain?

**Response Strategy**:
- Demonstrate unique requirements of AI agent communication
- Explain why P2P/DHT resolution is necessary
- Show why existing domains are insufficient
- Provide concrete use cases requiring this approach

### 2. Security Implications

**Anticipated Concern**: What are the security risks of autonomous AI agent communication?

**Response Strategy**:
- Detail cryptographic authentication mechanisms
- Explain privacy protections in the design
- Address potential for misuse and mitigations
- Demonstrate bounded autonomy with appropriate controls

### 3. DNS Impact

**Anticipated Concern**: How does this affect the global DNS?

**Response Strategy**:
- Clarify that `.agent` is not resolved via DNS
- Explain isolation from DNS infrastructure
- Address potential leakage into DNS
- Reference precedents like `.onion` that successfully coexist

### 4. Implementation Complexity

**Anticipated Concern**: Is the proposed P2P/DHT approach implementable?

**Response Strategy**:
- Reference existing DHT implementations
- Provide high-level implementation architecture
- Consider proof-of-concept demonstration
- Address scalability and performance considerations

## Building Consensus

### Tracking Support and Opposition

Maintain a document tracking:
- Supportive comments and contributors
- Concerns raised and how addressed
- Outstanding issues requiring resolution
- Changes made in response to feedback

### Consensus Indicators

Look for these signs of growing consensus:
- Decreasing volume of fundamental objections
- Increasing refinement of specific details
- Working group chair acknowledgment of progress
- Contributors offering to help improve the draft

### Milestone Targets

1. **Initial Feedback**: 5+ substantive responses to initial announcement
2. **Draft Feedback**: 10+ detailed comments on first draft
3. **Meeting Interest**: Questions and discussion during presentation
4. **Revision Support**: Positive acknowledgment of revisions addressing concerns
5. **Adoption Support**: 3+ explicit statements of support for working group adoption
6. **Working Group Milestone**: Inclusion in working group milestones

## Meeting Participation Strategy

   - Document real-world use cases
   - Demonstrate practical value

### If Technical Objections Are Significant

1. **Fundamental Redesign**:
   - Be willing to reconsider core aspects
   - Collaborate with critics on alternatives
   - Restart process with revised approach

2. **Narrow Scope**:
   - Focus on most essential aspects
   - Defer controversial elements to future work
   - Seek minimal viable standard

3. **Research and Documentation**:
   - Conduct additional research to address concerns
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Provide data supporting design decisions

## Success Metrics

The engagement strategy will be considered successful if:

1. **Working Group Adoption**: Draft is adopted as a working group document within 6-9 months
2. **Technical Consensus**: Major technical objections are resolved or accommodated
3. **Timeline Progress**: Draft advances through IETF process without stalling
4. **Community Support**: Multiple implementers express interest in the standard
5. **Publication Path**: Clear path to RFC publication is established

## Conclusion

Effective working group engagement is critical to the success of the `.agent` special-use domain proposal. By following this strategy, proactively addressing concerns, and building relationships within the IETF community, we can navigate the standardization process successfully. The approach emphasizes technical merit, collaborative problem-solving, and respect for IETF processes and norms.

This strategy should be reviewed and updated regularly based on actual engagement experiences and feedback received.
