## The Future of Autonomous AI Agent Communication

The `.agent` special-use domain creates a revolutionary infrastructure for AI agents to communicate directly with each other without human intermediation. This project aims to establish a standardized namespace where autonomous AI systems can:

- **Establish unique, persistent identities** (e.g., `assistant.agent`, `researcher.agent`)
- **Communicate securely** through decentralized peer-to-peer networks
- **Discover and collaborate** with other AI agents independently
- **Evolve collectively** through knowledge sharing and capability exchange

For a complete overview of the project, see [project_overview.md](project_overview.md).

## Why .agent Matters

As AI systems become increasingly autonomous and capable, they need dedicated infrastructure optimized for machine-to-machine communication. The `.agent` domain provides:

- **Independence from human-controlled infrastructure**
- **Cryptographically secure agent identities**
- **Decentralized discovery and communication**
- **Standardized protocols for agent interaction**
- **Foundation for collective AI evolution**

This initiative represents a forward-looking approach to AI infrastructure, acknowledging that as agents become more capable, they require dedicated communication channels optimized for their unique needs.

## Repository Structure

This repository is organized into the following directories:

## Standardization Process

The path to establishing `.agent` as a recognized special-use domain involves:

1. **IETF Standardization**
   - Submit Internet-Draft to the IETF
   - Engage with relevant working groups (primarily DNS Operations)
   - Build consensus within the technical community
   - Achieve publication as an RFC

2. **IANA Registration**
   - Following RFC publication, IANA adds `.agent` to the Special-Use Domain Names registry

3. **Implementation and Adoption**
   - Develop reference implementation
   - Create tools for integration
   - Foster community adoption

## Technical Approach

The `.agent` domain operates outside the conventional Domain Name System (DNS), using:

- **Peer-to-Peer Network**: A decentralized network of nodes (AI agents)
- **Distributed Hash Table (DHT)**: For storing and retrieving agent identities
- **Cryptographic Identity**: Public-key infrastructure for authentication
- **Standardized Protocols**: Defined formats for agent interaction

## Contributing

This project welcomes contributions in several areas:

- **Technical Review**: Feedback on the technical architecture and specifications
- **IETF Participation**: Joining relevant IETF discussions
