# GitHub Setup Instructions

This document provides instructions for pushing this project to GitHub and setting up the repository for optimal visibility and collaboration.

## Creating a GitHub Repository

1. **Create a new repository on GitHub**:
   - Go to [GitHub](https://github.com) and sign in
   - Click the "+" icon in the top right and select "New repository"
   - Repository name: `agent-domain-project` (or your preferred name)
   - Description: "A special-use domain (.agent) for autonomous AI agent communication"
   - Make it Public
   - Do NOT initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have these)
   - Click "Create repository"

2. **Push your local repository to GitHub**:
   ```bash
   # Add the remote repository
   git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/agent-domain-project.git

   # Push the code
   git push -u origin master
   ```

## Repository Settings

After pushing to GitHub, configure these settings:

1. **General Settings**:
   - Enable "Discussions" feature
   - Enable "Sponsorships" if you want to receive financial support
   - Set up "Social preview" image (create one that visually represents the project)

2. **Collaborators & Teams**:
   - Add key team members as collaborators

3. **Branches**:
   - Set up branch protection for `master` or `main` branch
   - Require pull request reviews before merging
   - Require status checks to pass before merging

4. **Pages**:
   - Enable GitHub Pages from the `main` branch or a `/docs` folder
   - Select a theme
   - This will create a project website at `https://[username].github.io/agent-domain-project/`

5. **Security**:
   - Enable security advisories
   - Enable Dependabot alerts (if you add code later)

## Enhancing Discoverability

1. **Add Topics to Your Repository**:
   - Go to your repository page
   - Click the "gear" icon next to "About" on the right sidebar
   - Add relevant topics such as:
     - agent-domain
     - ai-communication
     - special-use-domain
     - ietf-standards
     - autonomous-ai
     - p2p-network
     - distributed-hash-table
     - ai-infrastructure
     - open-standards

2. **Create a GitHub Project**:
   - Set up a project board to track development tasks
   - Create columns like "To Do", "In Progress", "Review", and "Done"
   - Add initial issues based on the project roadmap

3. **Set Up GitHub Discussions**:
   - Create initial discussion categories:
     - Announcements
     - Technical Discussion
     - Use Cases
     - Standards Process
     - Q&A
     - General
   - Post a welcome message in Announcements

## Promoting Your Repository

1. **Create a Release**:
   - Create an initial v0.1.0 release
   - Include a summary of the project's purpose and current status
   - This makes it easier for people to cite or reference a specific version

2. **Set Up Repository Insights**:
   - Monitor traffic to your repository
   - Track clones, views, and referral sources
   - Use this data to refine your outreach strategy

3. **Create a Community Profile**:
   - Ensure your repository has all recommended community files
   - GitHub will show a "community profile" score based on presence of:
     - README.md (already created)
     - CONTRIBUTING.md (already created)
     - CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (consider adding)
     - Issue templates (already created)
     - Pull request template (already created)

## Next Steps After GitHub Setup

1. **Create Project Website**:
   - Consider creating a dedicated website beyond GitHub Pages
   - Use the SEO keywords from SEO_KEYWORDS.md
   - Include clear calls-to-action for different audience segments

2. **Set Up Social Media**:
   - Create Twitter/X account: @agentdomain
   - Create LinkedIn page for the project
   - Set up Discord server for community discussions

3. **Reach Out to Potential Sponsors and Contributors**:
   - Use the GitHub repository as the central reference point
   - Prepare a brief email template introducing the project
   - Target organizations and individuals identified in the research

4. **Begin IETF Engagement**:
   - Join relevant IETF mailing lists
   - Share the GitHub repository with select IETF participants for early feedback
   - Refine the Internet-Draft based on initial feedback

## Maintaining GitHub Momentum

1. **Regular Updates**:
   - Commit regularly to show project activity
   - Post updates in Discussions
   - Create new releases for significant milestones

2. **Engage with Issues and Pull Requests**:
   - Respond promptly to new issues and pull requests
   - Thank contributors for their input
   - Provide constructive feedback

3. **Track Stars and Forks**:
   - Monitor who is starring and forking your repository
   - Reach out to organizations showing interest
   - Use this data to identify potential collaborators or sponsors

4. **Leverage GitHub Insights**:
   - Review traffic patterns
   - Identify which documents are getting the most attention
   - Refine content based on user interest

Remember that GitHub is both a code hosting platform and a social network for developers. Active engagement and responsiveness will help build community interest in the project.
